# Exercices for [Python Syntax](../PY-101/02_Python-Basics/04_Python-Syntax.md) and Control Structures

## Exercise Set 1: Basic Structure and Indentation
1. **Fix the Syntax**
   Look at this code and fix all syntax errors:

   ```python
   def calculate_total price, tax
   result = price + (price * tax)
   return result
   
   print(calculate_total(100, 0.2)
   ```

2. **Indentation Challenge**
   Properly indent this code to make it work:
   ```python
   def check_temperature(temp):
   if temp > 30:
   print("It's hot!")
   if temp > 35:
   print("It's very hot!")
   else:
   print("It's warm")
   else:
   print("It's not hot")
   ```
