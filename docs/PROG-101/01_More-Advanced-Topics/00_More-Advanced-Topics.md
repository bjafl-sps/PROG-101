# More Advanced Topics

## [7 Abstraction and Modularity](./07_Abstraction-and-modularity.md)
These concepts involve breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable parts (modularity) and hiding unnecessary details while focusing on essential features (abstraction).

## [8 Data Structures](./08_Data-structures.md)
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data effectively, while algorithms are the methods used to manipulate this data. Understanding different data structures and algorithms helps in designing efficient programs.

## [9 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](./09_Object-Oriented-Programming.md)
OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, each containing data and methods that operate on the data. It encourages reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance of code.

## [10 Version Control and Collaboration](./10_Version-Control-and-Collaboration.md)
Learning how to use version control systems like Git enables programmers to track changes to their code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects effectively.
