# Exercices for [Variables](../PY-101/02_Python-Basics/02_Varibles.md)

## Exercise Set 1: Variable Basics
1. **Name Game**
   Write a program that:
   - Creates variables for first name, last name, and age
   - Follows Python naming conventions (snake_case)
   - Prints all variables
   - Includes comments explaining your naming choices

2. **Variable Swap**
   Create a program that:
   - Creates two variables with different values
   - Swaps their values
   - Prints the values before and after swapping

## Exercise Set 2: Variable Naming Rules
3. **Identify Valid Names**
   Look at these variable names and comment which are valid and which are invalid:
   ```python
   # Add comments to explain why each is valid or invalid
   first_name = "John"
   1st_name = "John"
   firstName = "John"
   first-name = "John"
   _first_name = "John"
   first name = "John"
   ```

4. **Fix Bad Names**
   Improve these variable names according to Python conventions:
   ```python
   x = "John Smith"
   a = 25
   thing = "Developer"
   DATA = True
   ```

## Exercise Set 3: Variable Reassignment
5. **Value Tracking**
   Write a program that:
   - Creates a variable called `counter`
   - Assigns it different values five times
   - Prints the value after each assignment
   - Comments showing what you expect the output to be
