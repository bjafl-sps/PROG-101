# Programming Languages

Previously we looked at general principles in programming. These principles are basic building blocks and concepts that are useful to be familiar with when starting out your journey into the world of programming. But to actually write code, you need to use a specific programming language. 

Using a programming language will enable you to communicate with computers. The languages consist of a set of rules, symbols, and syntax that enable humans to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute.

Just like human languages, programming languages have their grammar, vocabulary, and rules. However, instead of communicating with other people, programming languages allow programmers to create software, applications, websites, games, and more.

These languages vary in their purposes, complexities, and applications. Some are designed for specific tasks, while others are more versatile and can be used across various domains. Each programming language has its strengths, weaknesses, and unique features, making them suitable for different kinds of projects and scenarios.

Learning a programming language is akin to learning a new way of expressing thoughts and solving problems. With practice and understanding, individuals can harness the power of these languages to create innovative solutions, automate tasks, analyze data, and build the technologies that shape our modern world.


## Popular languages
There are many programming languages, and there is no need to learn them all. And if you master one language, it's not too hard to learn another if you need to. Five of the most used programming languages are:

1. **JavaScript**: Widely used for web development, it's the primary language for front-end development and increasingly used for back-end development (Node.js). Its versatility and extensive ecosystem make it highly popular.

2. **Python**: Known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Python is used in various domains such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more.

3. **Java**: A robust, object-oriented language, commonly used for building enterprise-level applications, Android app development, large-scale systems, and server-side applications.

4. **C#**: Developed by Microsoft, C# is used for Windows applications, game development with Unity, and enterprise software development, particularly within the .NET framework.

5. **C/C++**: Both languages are known for their efficiency and are used in system programming, game development, embedded systems, operating systems, and performance-critical applications.


## Overview of different languages
Here is a list of some of the languages that are common. They are grouped according to typical use-cases. The list is not exhaustive, and some of the languages could be used for more than the subject they are listed under. This list is just to show you a bit of what's out there. As mentioned, just learning one language goes a long way, and once you master the skilles and basics of programming it's not too hard to learn another language. It's certanly easier than learning chinese if you only know european languages...
