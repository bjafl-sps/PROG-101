# Exercices for [Python Basics](../PY-101/02_Python-Basics/01_Python-Basics.md)

## Exercise Set 1: Comments and Basic Printing
1. **First Steps with Comments**
   Write a program that includes:
   - A comment with your name
   - A comment explaining what the program does
   - A `print()` statement that displays "Hello, World!"

2. **Comment Practice**
   Look at the following code and add some comments explaining what each line does:
   ```python
   name = "Alice"
   age = 25
   print(name)
   print(age)
   ```

## Exercise Set 2: Basic Operations
3. **Calculator Practice**
   Create a program that:
   - Creates two variables with different numbers
   - Performs all basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) between them
   - Prints each result
   - Includes comments explaining each operation

4. **String Operations**
   Write a program that:
   - Creates two variables containing your first and last name
   - Concatenates them with a space in between
   - Prints the full name
   - Prints the length of your full name

## Exercise Set 3: Variables and Types
5. **Type Explorer**
   Create variables of different types and use `type()` to explore them:
   - Create an integer variable
   - Create a float variable
   - Create a string variable
   - Create a boolean variable
   - Print the type of each variable

6. **Variable Transformation**
   Write a program that:
   - Creates a number variable with the value 42
   - Converts it to a string and stores it in a new variable
   - Prints both variables and their types

## Exercise Set 4: Functions
7. **Simple Function Creation**
   Create a function that:
   - Takes no parameters
   - Prints "Good morning!" when called
   - Call the function three times

8. **Basic Calculator Function**
   Write a function that:
   - Takes two numbers as parameters
   - Prints their sum
   - Prints their difference
   - Prints their product
   - Call the function with different numbers

## Exercise Set 5: Indentation Practice
9. **Fix the Indentation**
   Fix the indentation in the following code:
   ```python
   def greet(name):
   print("Hello")
   print(name)
   print("How are you?")
   ```

10. **Create Nested Code**
    Write a program that:
    - Creates a function containing an if statement
    - Uses proper indentation
    - Has at least three levels of indentation

## Challenge Exercises
11. **Mini Calculator Program**
    Create a program that:
    - Defines separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
    - Takes two numbers as input
    - Performs all operations
    - Includes appropriate comments
    - Uses proper indentation
    - Prints results in a formatted way

12. **Type Converter**
    Write a program that:
    - Creates variables of different types (int, float, string)
    - Converts between these types where possible
    - Includes error handling comments for impossible conversions
    - Prints the original and converted values with their types

## Tips for Completing These Exercises:
- Try to solve each exercise without looking at solutions first
- Test your code with different inputs
- Pay attention to proper indentation
- Add comments to explain your code
- If you get stuck, break the problem into smaller parts
- Remember to use meaningful variable names
