# Core Aspects of Programming

## The basics

### [1 Problem-Solving](./01_Problem-Solving.md)
Programming involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts and devising algorithms or step-by-step procedures to solve them.

### [2 Syntax and Logic](./02_Syntax-and-logic.md)
Understanding the syntax and logical structures of a programming language is crucial. Syntax refers to the rules governing how code is written, while logic involves creating sequences of instructions that produce the desired output. 
Think of syntax as grammars in a language, there are rules in any language about how to build sentences and texts to make it understandable. Messing up grammar can, in addition to adding a frown on the readers face, confuse the meaning of your message. 
In programming, logic means figuring out step-by-step instructions that make sense to a computer. It's like creating a path for the computer to follow by setting up rules and conditions. Good logic helps code run smoothly and do the right things based on different situations or inputs. It's all about making sure the computer understands what you want it to do!

### [3 Data Types and Variables](./03_Data-types-and-variables.md)
Data types represent different kinds of information (such as numbers, text, or Boolean values) that can be used and manipulated within a program. Variables are containers that hold values of these data types, allowing programmers to store and manipulate data dynamically.

### [4 Control Structures](./04_Control-structures.md)
These dictate the flow of execution within a program. Examples include loops (repeating a set of instructions), conditional statements (executing code based on certain conditions), and functions (reusable blocks of code).

### [5 Algorithms](./05_Algorithms.md)
To solve problems you need to first understand them well. Then you break down a solution to step-by-step procedures. These procedures are called algorithms, and developing efficent algorithms is at the core of programming. Good problem-solving skills, creativity and logic skills are crucial in creating effective and optimized algorithms.

### [6 Debugging and Testing](./06_Debugging-and-testing.md)
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in the code. Testing involves verifying that the code works as expected and handles various scenarios correctly. A code snippet often doesen't do exactly what you expected. When you are writing a text (for humans) it's normal to do some typos or gramatical errors that change the meaning of the text. Then you need to read over the text and maybe have a friend check it for you. It's the same when writing code for a computer, you need to check for typos or syntax errors to make sure the computer understands your intentions.
